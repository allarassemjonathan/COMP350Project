INSTALLING OUR APP

1 - Download the zip
2 - Extract the zip in a folder
3 - Make sure you have a student_info.txt file in your project folder
4 - Build and Run the driver.java


Minor features we implemented that were not included in the MVP:

As a user, I must be able to search classes by course number
The system must sanitize input to protect from attacks and from crashes
